# Compliance Statement for Pennsylvania CARES Documentation

**Repository:** Pennsylvania CARES and all its subsidiaries including myPACares.net
**Managing Entity:** Seven Mountains EMS Council (on behalf of the Pennsylvania CARES Program)

## Purpose & Scope

This GitHub repository hosts documentation, website source code, technical resources, and process guides for the Pennsylvania Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (PA CARES) program. The content is intended to support licensed and CARES-participating EMS agencies, participating hospitals, regional EMS councils, and authorized personnel under the governance of the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Pennsylvania CARES Coordinator.

PA CARES is the state-level implementation of the national CARES program, which is a **public health surveillance and quality improvement activity** authorized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The registry follows Utstein-style reporting guidelines and its dataset is fully integrated with the **National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) Version 3.5.0 standard**.

**Critical Disclaimer:** This repository does NOT contain, host, or process any Protected Health Information (PHI), confidential patient data, or live registry data. It contains only administrative, educational, and technical documentation.

## Legal & Regulatory Adherence

All operations and data management practices of the PA CARES program itself adhere to:

*   The Pennsylvania EMS Act (Act 37 of 2009)
*   The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules, specifically operating under **45 CFR § 164.512(b)** for authorized public health surveillance and quality improvement activities.
*   The **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)** between the CDC and Emory University that establishes CARES as a public health activity.
*   Formal **Data Use Agreements (DUA)** executed between the Pennsylvania CARES program and each participating entity (EMS agency, hospital).
*   National consensus standards, including the **Utstein guidelines** for cardiac arrest reporting and **NEMSIS data standards**.
*   All other applicable federal and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania laws governing patient privacy and confidential medical information.

The materials in this repository are published to facilitate compliance with these laws, regulations, and agreements by authorized users.

## Authorized Access & Use

*   **Primary Audience:** Pennsylvania EMS agencies and participating hospitals that are signatories to the PA CARES DUA, their authorized personnel, regional EMS council staff, and the Pennsylvania CARES oversight team. Access to the live registry is contingent upon a formal, executed agreement.
*   **Use Case:** The documentation is to be used as a guide for implementing, reporting to, and utilizing the CARES registry to improve cardiac arrest response and patient outcomes across the continuum of care—from bystander intervention through hospital treatment.
*   **Restrictions:** The technical and procedural information here is not intended for public redistribution or commercial use. It is provided "as-is" for the benefit of the Pennsylvania EMS and hospital communities participating in CARES under formal agreement.

## Security & Data Handling (Regarding the Registry)

*   The actual CARES registry data is housed in secure, HIPAA-compliant platforms separate from this documentation site.
*   The PA CARES program and Seven Mountains EMS Council employ robust administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all sensitive data.
*   Data collection and sharing are authorized for public health purposes under the CDC's HIPAA provision **45 CFR § 164.512(b)**.
*   Identifiable data elements (e.g., name, date of birth) are used temporarily for the sole purpose of record linkage and are systematically de-identified and scrubbed following established auditing procedures.
*   Data access for participating entities is strictly governed by the DUA, is role-based, and is audited.

## Ethical Commitment

Our work with the CARES registry is guided by the highest ethical standards, focusing on quality improvement, respect for patient dignity, and the advancement of evidence-based pre-hospital and hospital care across the Commonwealth. We are committed to transparency in our processes and fostering trust with all stakeholders, including EMS providers, hospital teams, patients, and the communities we collectively serve.

## Repository Content Management

*   This `COMPLIANCE.md` file and all associated documentation will be reviewed periodically.
*   Updates will be made to reflect changes in law, program policy, technology, or best practices.
*   Significant changes to core compliance or data handling guidance will be communicated to stakeholders via standard PA CARES channels.
